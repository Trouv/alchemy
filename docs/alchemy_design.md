# Alchemy System
The alchemy system is the absolute core of this game.
The game is built around the player's ability to farm/gather ingredients, brew potions, refine them, and sell/gift/use them.
Here we'll document the broad goals of this system and some possible solutions to meet these goals.
Design changes, if they're significant enough, should also probably be documented here.

Warning: this document contains spoilers for the game.
Discovering and experimenting with these mechanics is part of the fun!

### Design Goals
1. Systemic/emergent - no scripted recipes
2. Technical - takes some physical skill, dexterity, mastery
3. Meritocratic - Better results require more skill, more complicated recipes, rearer ingredients, etc
4. Obscure - internal workings not revealed to player.
   Though, they may be discoverable through experimentation, or progressing the story/side quests.
